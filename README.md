# Ourspace (WIP)

Frontend for [Repstation](https://github.com/gigamesh/repstation)

## Description (todos)

- [ ] Lets you sign in
- [ ] Shows your rep score
- [ ] Enables setting profile data (via making attestations directly to EAS)
- [ ] Enables “friending” another account (positive attestation)
- [ ] Shows who has friended you and who you’ve friended
- [ ] Let’s you see your “top 8” ala myspace, ranked by their rep
- [ ] Let's you make attestation to override rep ranking so you can specify your top 8
